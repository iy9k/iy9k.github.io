# My first repo on Github :D

Salamu Alaykum (Peace be upon you) for any new person that does not know me (thats basically everyone :skull:), my name is iy9k and I am apart of a program that brings me to a uni in my city for a week, and I get to choose a course from beforehand. I chose the course (or was given this course, see below for explanation) named "Develop your own website". I am not paid enough to write all this so I go to new paragraph.

# What do I mean by "choosing course"?

I mean like, you get up to 10 courses to choose on the sign-up page, then you are given a course based on your selection

# conclusion
gonna complete this later
